# School-Management-System-using-Python-Flask-MySQL
This project aims to develop a comprehensive School Management System (SMS) using Python, Flask, and MySQL. This web-based application will streamline various administrative tasks and enhance the overall management of educational institutions.
The School Management System (SMS) will provide a user-friendly interface for managing user logins, ensuring secure access to authorized personnel. It will facilitate the efficient management of teachers, students, classes, sections, subjects, and attendance records. Key features include:

1. User Login Management: Secure authentication and authorization for administrators, teachers, and students.
2. Teacher Management: Maintain teacher profiles, assign subjects, and manage schedules.
3. Student Management: Enroll new students, update records, and track academic performance.
4. Class and Section Management: Create and manage classes, sections, and timetables.
5. Subject Management: Define subjects, assign teachers, and manage curricula.
6. Attendance Management: Record and monitor student attendance, generate reports.
7. Attendance Reporting: Generate comprehensive attendance reports for analysis and decision-making.

The backend will be developed using Python and the Flask framework, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. MySQL will be utilized as the database management system, providing reliable data storage and retrieval. The frontend will be built using React, delivering a responsive and intuitive user interface.

This project will streamline school operations, enhance data management, and promote better communication between stakeholders. It will serve as a valuable tool for educational institutions, enabling efficient resource allocation, academic tracking, and informed decision-making processes.
